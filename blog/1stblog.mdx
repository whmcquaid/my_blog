    Ok, so I'm probably not a pulitzer prize winning writer, but I would like to
    talk a little bit about what brought me here. I learned to code when I was
    in middle school. I joined a guild for my favorite game, diablo, which I
    played with my friends online. As my contribution to the guild I set out to
    build the website. Thus began my journey learning HTML.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    On every page that would allow me, I would right click and hit 'view source'
    and begin copy and pasting to my own text editor (most likely wordpad) until
    I had a working website dedicated to the game I loved to play. Soon after I
    learned turbo pascal and some visual basic in a technology class in school.
    I became a total computer nerd. Focused on gaming, I built my own machines
    from the ground up. I blacked out my windows with hurricane shutters and had
    a permanent LAN party. I allowed my friends to use the extra PCs I had built
    and played entirely too much counter-strike, unreal tournament, quake 3
    arena, diablo, and starcraft to name a few.{' '}
  </p>

    Having these interests made me the defacto tech support to all my family and
    neighbors. While I was in highschool my father got his brokers license and
    started his own real-estate business. It was assumed that I would build the
    website. I used the latest technology (microsoft dreamweaver) and crafted a
    minimalist site my father used to sell over 700 houses in one year, 99% of
    which were site unseen (they only saw what I put on the website. My father
    is one hell of a salesman).{' '}

    During this economic boost for my family I dual enrolled in college classes
    and learned to surf. I became less interested in computers and more
    interested in my friends and surfing. I was not sure what path I wanted to
    take. When the real-estate market crashed my family lost everything
    including my home and my parents home.

    This was a dark time in my life and I made a lot of mistakes. Mistakes which
    I thought for years would keep me from being able to fulfill my dream of becoming
    a software engineer. Not seeing a way for me to fulfill the dream, I focused
    on honing a skill to make money. My skill became pools and I learned everything
    I could so that I can diagnose and fix almost any problem on any pool.{' '}

    A little over a year ago I discovered Underdog Devs and found hope in the
    community of developers focused on helping people like myself with a less
    than perfect past build the skills needed, and get help to finding
    employment in the tech industry. So, while I work full time in the Florida
    heat during the day, by night I find myself behind the glow that captured my
    curiosity so long ago.
