    Yesterday, I spent an hour staring at the errors my code was creating,
    hopelessly trying to figure out what typescript was trying to tell me. You
    see, I had built my portfolio site in typescript and react because I love
    all the code suggestions and error prevention of typescript and how easy it
    can be to be to get up and running with react.

    Originally my project component was about 200 lines of code because, well, I
    just wanted to get something up and running. Since I was able to get something
    up and hosted on vercel for free and it had been a minute since I had looked
    at the code at all, I decided to go back and refactor that component specifically
    to modularize the content, moving the data from that .js file into separate files.
    I had about 20-30 lines that repeated for each project so I was able to reduce
    all that down to just a few lines with a .map function.
  </p>
  <p>
    {' '}
    So, back to the error I stared at and could not figure out. Typescript was telling
    me I needed a comma instead of a period for my .map function. So, knowing that
    ','map was not what needed to happen, I began googling. My searches to find my
    specific error with a .map function didn't yield any results so I tried moving
    various curly braces and parenthesis around. I was able to create brand new errors,
    but nothing I did got it working.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    It was not until I asked my mentor, Amit, for help that he was able to spot
    the mistake. Low and behold I had put the arguments for my .map function in
    the wrong order. Simple mistake. It was easy to spot after looking at the
    MDN docs for array.map.{' '}
  </p>
  <p>
    This is just one example of how easy it can be to get stuck when working by
    oneself. The lesson here for me is that I may need the fresh set of eyes to
    spot the simple mistakes at times. This is not the first time for this type
    of bug and likely won't be the last. This simple bug was humbling learning
    experience for me. Now, my project component is much more easily readable
    and concise. I am happy to say I got it from over 200 to just 22 lines.
