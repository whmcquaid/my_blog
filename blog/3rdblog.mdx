<p>I have been doing pools now for about 5 years.  I have been with the company I am with now for the last 2.
  But that's quickly coming to an end.  Today, I gave my two weeks notice.<p></p>  It's not that I hate my job, or that
  my boss is an asshole.  Actually, quite the opposite.  I have a great relationship with my boss.  We get along great.  I would
  go so far as to say I consider him like family.  I love my job most of the time.  It is difficult to love it this time of year.
  Cleaning pools is not fun when the temperature feels like 110 degrees Fahrenheit. <p></p> My family and the people I grew up with
  sometimes ask me why I am not working in IT.  My adolescence was spent behind the glow of a windows PC.  I absolutely love gaming and tinkering with
  computers, so I built several of my own.  I bought larger heat sinks and fans and overclocked my processors.  I set up a LAN at home with 3 of the machines
  in my room.  I built and maintained my father's business website.  My best friend from that time lives in SF and has always had a job in tech.  <p></p>
  I took a different route.  A harder route.  I chose to make a lot of mistakes.  I believed for a long time that because of those mistakes I would never
  be able to have a career doing what I love.  I settled into doing pools and learned everything I could on the subject until I became an expert.  If there is
  an issue with a pool I can troubleshoot it, and make the repair.  I take great pride in my work but I know I cannot do it forever.
   I am only 37 but after a hard day at work I definetly feel old.  My body does at least.  </p><p>I day dream while cleaning pools of what my future could look like.
   Since I joined a community called <a href='https://www.underdogdevs.org'>Underdog Devs</a> , after work and on the weekends I have been working on
   making those dreams a reality.  </p><p> Someone saw all my effort and decided to be extremely generous.  I have been given the amazing opportunity of being part of the 1st
   cohort of Project Underdog.  This program offers guided instruction and development through one on one pair programming
    sessions with industry professionals several times per week.  I feel like this will take me to the next level really fast. </p><p>
    In the meantime I am prepping for interviews.  Not only have I been given the amazing opportunity offered by Underdog Devs Project Underdog but I
    have also applied for <a href='https://www.nextchapterproject.org/'>Next Chapter</a>'s apprenticeship program.  It is through them I have the incredible
    opportunity of interviewing with their partner companies.  </p><p>At this moment in my life I am blown away by how much the doors are opening for me to step
    into my dream job.  So, I keep working and learning everyday trying to get better.  </p><p>Since Project Underdog pays my bills, I quit my job.
    In under two weeks I will be able to code all day long and really focus on honing my skills.  </p>
